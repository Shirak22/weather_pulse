# Weather Pulse

This live demo is available at: https://fun.swehost.dev/weather_pulse/

## Project Overview

Weather Pulse is a web-based weather visualization application built using Vanilla JavaScript, PixiJS, and Leaflet.

### Technologies Used

* **Vanilla JavaScript**: The core programming language used to bring the application to life.
* **PixiJS**: A high-performance, multi-platform 2D rendering engine that powers the visualizations.
* **Leaflet**: A popular JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.

### Data Source

The application leverages open data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).

## Project Development Timeline

Weather Pulse took approximately 1 month to develop, including learning curves associated with PixiJS, understanding SMHI's open data format, and integrating Leaflet into the project. This was a new experience for me, except for Vanilla JavaScript-oriented programming.

### Key Takeaways

While there is still much room for optimization and development, building Weather Pulse was an enjoyable journey that allowed me to explore new technologies and create something visually engaging with SMHI's weather data.
